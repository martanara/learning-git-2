            <p>
                Someone said they left together<br>
                I ran out the door to get her<br>
                She was holding hands with Trevor<br>
                Not the greatest feeling ever<br>
                Said, "Pull yourself together<br>
                You should try your luck with Heather"<br>
                Then I heard they slept together<br>
                Oh, the less I know the better<br>
                The less I know the better
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side<br>
                No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night<br>
                Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind<br>
                Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind<br>
                So goodbye
            </p>
            <p>
                She said, "It's not now or never<br>
                Wait ten years, we'll be together"<br>
                I said, "Better late than never<br>
                Just don't make me wait forever"<br>
                Don't make me wait forever<br>
                Don't make me wait forever<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?<br>
                I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind<br>
                I was doing fine without you<br>
                'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase<br>
                Giving in to all his bullshit<br>
                Is this what you want, is this who you are?<br>
                I was doing fine without you<br>
                'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine<br>
                Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you<br>
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br>
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br>
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
